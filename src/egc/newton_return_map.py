"""Newton return map for contact tractions as preprocessing step.

Add a preprocessing step before every nonlinear iteration that functions
as a return map for the contact forces. If the tangential traction is
larger in magnitude than the friction bound (whose value depends on
the current guess of the normal traction), it is projected back to the
boundary. Similarly, if the normal traction is larger than zero, it is
projected back to the "boundary" of zero.
