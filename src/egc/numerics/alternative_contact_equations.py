        The equation is dimensionless, as we use nondimensionalized contact traction.

            C_t = max(b_p, ||T_t+c_t u_t||) T_t - max(0, b_p) (T_t+c_t u_t)

        with `u` being displacement jump increments, `t` denoting tangential component
        and `b_p` the friction bound.

        For `b_p = 0`, the equation `C_t = 0` does not in itself imply `T_t = 0`, which
        is what the contact conditions require. The case is handled through the use of a
        characteristic function.

        """Ad maximum function represented as an AdArray.

        The maximum function is defined as the element-wise maximum of two arrays.
        At equality, the Jacobian is taken from the first argument. The order of the
        arguments may be important, since it determines which Jacobian is used in
        the case of equality.

        The arguments can be either AdArrays or ndarrays, this duality is needed to allow
        for parsing of operators that can be taken at the current iteration (in which case
        it will parse as an AdArray) or at the previous iteration or time step (in which
        case it will parse as a numpy array).


        Parameters:
            var_0: First argument to the maximum function.
            var_1: Second argument.

            If one of the input arguments is scalar, broadcasting will be used.


        Returns:
            The maximum of the two arguments, taken element-wise in the arrays. The return
            type is AdArray if at least one of the arguments is an AdArray, otherwise it
            is an ndarray. If an AdArray is returned, the Jacobian is computed according to
            the maximum values of the AdArrays (so if element ``i`` of the maximum is
            picked from ``var_0``, row ``i`` of the Jacobian is also picked from the
            Jacobian of ``var_0``). If ``var_0`` is a ndarray, its Jacobian is set to zero.
